This is my final course project for IBM's Developing Front-End Apps with React course on Coursera, titled e-plantShopping. It's a very basic shopping page with landing page, product selection, and a cart. Basiclaly a way to test the features of React and Redux. 

Some of this code is theirs and some of it is mine. If you'd like to see more of my work (and some of theirs) go to https://github.com/King-Forge.
